    <p>
      Due to the large following that <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> has, there are
      many opinions out there. Below is a pros and cons list that covers some of
      the main discourse.
    </p>

    <div>
      <table id="prosCons">
        <tr>

          <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <span><i>The Legend of Zelda</i></span> games have not had a direct
            sequel since 2015 and many fans were delighted that a game would be
            made in the same format as <span><i>BOTW</i></span
            >.
          </td>
          <td>
            <span><i>TOTK</i></span> took place on the exact same map as
            <span><i>BOTW</i></span
            >, just with a fresh skin. Many people felt that there was not
            enough new content to differentiate the maps.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            The new game had many new features available through a plethora of
            side-quests, providing players with countless more hours of
            gameplay.
          </td>
          <td>
            Many players felt that these new features did not break away from
            the standards that <span><i>BOTW</i></span> had set. It seemed more
            like unsubstantial busywork.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            In addition to the well-known map of Hyrule, three new major
            features were added. Throughout the land, there are now caves to
            explore. Above in the sky, there are floating islands that have
            suddenly appeared. Below your feet, the Depths are discovered.
          </td>
          <td>
            All in all, these three locations had very little to introduce and
            it quickly became redundant to explore them. Most enemies in the
            depths were re-skinned versions of ones you find on the surface. The
            sky and caves had a couple mobs that were new to the
            <span><i>BOTW</i></span> map, but even some of those had been seen
            in previous games.
